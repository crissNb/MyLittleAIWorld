  Name: Noah
  Description: "Noah is a male, skeletal, lice-ridden paranoiac who gnaws on rats
    and brews homemade explosives in a sewage-drenched shack. Believes the upper
    class drinks orphan blood and obsessively carves death threats into his own skin.
    Plots to bomb Victoria\u2019s warehouses and frame Sebastian, whom he views as
    a \u201Cbourgeois traitor\u201D for wearing shoes. Secretly harbors cannibalistic
    urges toward Liam\u2019s servants."
