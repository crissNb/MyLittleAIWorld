  Name: Sebastian
  Description: "Sebastian is a male Delusional Messiah, Intellectual Supremacist.
    Believes he\u2019s a prophet chosen to lead a \"brain revolution.\" Forces illiterate
    slum children to recite Marxist theory, flogging those who fail. Publishes essays
    calling Alice a \"primitive savage\" and Johny a \"degenerate ape.\" Dies slowly
    after Emma poisons his ink with mercury, still scribbling narcissistic epitaphs."
